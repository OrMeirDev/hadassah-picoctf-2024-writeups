# How to solve it

there's a link on heap attacks.

we have this command it's going to be 8 bytes since this is 32-bit architecture
# ![img_1.png](img_1.png)
so we have a 4 byte pointer
on what to do and a 4x8 pointer on the username we have a method here which is going to
happily read the flag and print it out for us this is good 
# ![img_2.png](img_2.png)
and this program that gets a line
this is a function pointer
# ![img_3.png](img_3.png)
so if we can fill in

this is going to be a malloc 
# ![img_4.png](img_4.png)
of size 8 and 8 is interesting because it's the
exact size of the command buffer

now i create simple python program

and the flag is:
