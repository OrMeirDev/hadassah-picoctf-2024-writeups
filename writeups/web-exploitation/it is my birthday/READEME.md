# It is my Birthday

This is the write-up for the challenge "It is my Birthday" challenge in PicoCTF

# The challenge

## Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! 
I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, 
and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! 
You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision.
 Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:20277/

## Hints
1.Look at the category of this problem.
2.How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?


## Initial look
The website seems to accept files and checks their MD5 hash. It then redirects based on a hash map,
indicating if the hashes are different and if the files are the same.

# How to solve it
Firstly, I visited the site and experimented with different kinds of files to understand its behavior. 
Then, I delved into MD5 and discovered that the hash map was cracked, allowing different files to share the same hash.
 Leveraging this knowledge, I utilized files provided, which were distinct but shared the same hash.

Upon submitting these files, I was redirected to another page revealing PHP code and the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{c0ngr4ts_u_r_1nv1t3d_da36cc1b}`
