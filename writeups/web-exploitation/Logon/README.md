# Logon 
This is the write-up for the challenge "logon" from picoCTF.

# The challenge

## Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

## Hints
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

## Initial look
The link above leads to the factory page which asks you to enter a username and password

# How to solve it
The first time I entered a random username admin and no password.
I received a message saying that I was able to log in but I am not allowed to see the flag.

The second time I tried to log in with the username Joe without a password, I got a message saying that Joe has a highly secure password and I'm not allowed to log in.

After realizing that any user who is not Joe can log in but still not see the content.
I decided to open the inspector and check on the network what the requests are that are sent and what permissions are in the header.
And I noticed the line "admin" which is in cookies.
which contains a False value.

And I thought of changing the admin value to True.
That's why I entered the cookies tag located in Storage and edited the admin field to True.

After I refreshed the page I got the flag:

So the flag is: picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc}
