#It is my Birthday

#describtion: 
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday!
I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar,
and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision.
Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.

solution: I searched for md5 hash in google found a website that can create 2 files with same md5 hash.
named them diffrenet since the hint says: "they are slightly diffrtent , uploaded this 2 files to the website that 
given in the description and got a access to the source code 
where i found the flag.
